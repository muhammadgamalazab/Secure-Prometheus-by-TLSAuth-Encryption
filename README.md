## Introduction
Prometheus is a powerful monitoring tool used to collect and query metrics. By default, Prometheus does not provide authentication, which can be a security risk. This guide will walk you through securing Prometheus and its targets by enabling HTTPS and basic authentication.

## Requirements
- Prometheus installed and running
- OpenSSL installed for generating certificates
- An HTTP reverse proxy such as Nginx or Apache (optional, for managing authentication)

## Generate SSL Certificates
Use OpenSSL to generate a self-signed SSL certificate for the Prometheus server.

```bash
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout prometheus.key -x509 -days 365 -out prometheus.crt
